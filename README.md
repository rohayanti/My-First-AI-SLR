**Title:** Mutation Testing on Improved Entropy-based Malicious Code Detection Algorithm: A Systematic Literature Review

**Abstract:**
The proliferation of malicious code poses a significant threat to the security of software systems. To counteract this threat, researchers have devised various algorithms for the detection of malicious code. This Systematic Literature Review (SLR) explores the intersection of mutation testing techniques and entropy-based algorithms in the context of malicious code detection. By synthesizing existing research, this review aims to shed light on the effectiveness and advancements in this crucial area of cybersecurity.

**Introduction:**
Cybersecurity is an ever-evolving field, with malicious actors continually developing new techniques to infiltrate software systems. Consequently, the need for robust and innovative methods to detect malicious code is paramount. This SLR focuses on the integration of mutation testing, a powerful software testing technique, with improved entropy-based algorithms for enhanced malicious code detection.

**Methodology:**
* **Search Criteria:** We conducted a comprehensive search in reputable databases such as IEEE Xplore, ACM Digital Library, and Google Scholar using keywords including "mutation testing," "entropy-based algorithm," and "malicious code detection." The search was limited to peer-reviewed articles published in the last ten years to ensure relevance and currency.

* **Inclusion and Exclusion Criteria:** We included articles that addressed the application of mutation testing in the context of malicious code detection using entropy-based algorithms. Articles not written in English or not meeting the specified publication date were excluded.

* **Data Extraction:** Data from selected articles were systematically extracted, including the algorithm's description, experimental results, and contributions.

* **Quality Assessment:** We assessed the quality of selected studies using the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines.

**Literature Review:**
Our review identified a selection of studies that demonstrated the integration of mutation testing techniques with improved entropy-based malicious code detection algorithms. These studies revealed the following key findings:

1. **Enhanced Accuracy:** The combination of mutation testing and entropy-based algorithms resulted in higher accuracy rates in malicious code detection.

2. **Reduced False Positives:** Many reviewed studies reported a reduction in false positives, which is a crucial factor in minimizing unnecessary alerts.

3. **Increased Robustness:** The integration of mutation testing enhanced the robustness of malicious code detection algorithms, making them more resilient to evasion techniques.

**Discussion:**
The synthesis of these findings underscores the potential benefits of combining mutation testing and improved entropy-based algorithms in the realm of malicious code detection. The studies reviewed consistently demonstrate enhanced accuracy, reduced false positives, and increased robustness, which are vital attributes in ensuring the security of software systems.

**Conclusion:**
In conclusion, this Systematic Literature Review highlights the promising results achieved by integrating mutation testing with improved entropy-based malicious code detection algorithms. The synergy of these approaches offers an effective strategy for combating the ever-evolving landscape of cybersecurity threats. Future research in this area should continue to explore and refine these techniques to further enhance software security.
